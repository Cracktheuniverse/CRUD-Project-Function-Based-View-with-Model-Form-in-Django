 CRUD Project Function Based View with Model Form in Django




In this Django Project I've created a Form (StudentRegistration form) with Create,Read,Update,and Delete (CRUD) features. You can Add New Details to the Database , Edit saved data, Delete any data from Database and you can view all data on the Front end page.



Run your project and test it


step 1 : python manage.py makemigrations


step 2 : python manage.py migrate


step 3 python manage.py runserver
